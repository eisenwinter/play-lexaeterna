## The Game

Lex Æterna is a turn-based monster brawl that can be played 
via the twitch chat. It may be a hommage to a few of our favorite monster battle games of the past mixed with some of the more fun mechanics of turn-based JRPGs.

### Basic Gameplay

The game is turn based. Each turn the opponents can attack each other with their monsters. 

Each monster has 3 stamina point wich can be used to cast spells. Stamina is your main ressource for casting spells and is reset each turn. 

One of Lex Æterna's key features is the **trinity-cast-system**, which may or may not be inspired by a great JRPG (;, spells deal more damage if they are re-casted. This bonus can stack up to 3 times and persists trough each turn as long as no other spell is casted in between.

The main goal of the game is to get your opponent down to zero HP. Duh.
