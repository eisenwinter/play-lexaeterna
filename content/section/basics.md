## The Game

Lex Æterna is a turn-based monster brawl that can be played 
via the twitch chat. It may be a hommage to a few of our favorite monster battle games of the past mixed with some of the more fun mechanics of turn-based JRPGs.

### Basic Gameplay

The game is turn based. Each turn the opponents can attack each other with their monsters. 

Each monster has 3 stamina point wich can be used to cast spells. Stamina is your main ressource for casting spells and is reset each turn. 

One of Lex Æterna's key features is the **trinity-cast-system**, which may or may not be inspired by a great JRPG, spells deal more damage if they are re-casted. This bonus can stack up to 3 times and persists trough each turn as long as no other spell is casted in between.

The main goal of the game is to get your opponent down to zero HP. Duh.


### How to play

Basically you join the twitch channel.

Once you did that you may choose a starting monster by typing `!start <ELEMENT>` in the chat.

The following elements are available:
- `!start light`
- `!start darkness`
- `!start water`
- `!start plant`
- `!start fire`
- `!start earth`
- `!start wind`
- `!start organic`

for more information regarding elements see below.

Once you got your starter you can join the matchmaking queue by typing `!join` and leave it by typing `!leave`.

If you monster is currently in a duel any of the following the letters in the chat will be interpreted as commands: 
`Q W E R S`
- `Q` will selected Q-Spell 
- `W` will selected the W-Spell
- `E` will selected the E-Spell
- `R` will selected the R-Spell
- `S` or `skip` will Skip the remaining stamina points and end your turn.

you may type a abitary combination of those like `qqs` or `q` `q` `s` or `E E E`. Casing and spaces do not matter.

I guess the easiest way to figure it out is just to try it...
